                    üëâüèº We‚Äôre in the process of updating our curriculum on web
                    development portfolios. We‚Äôll be moving all portfolio
                    lessons to Level 7. Please skip this lesson for now.

                    For this assignment, you‚Äôre going to create a portfolio that
                    you can use to market your skills and showcase your
                    projects. Please read this guide before getting started.

                <p>
                    Your portfolio will be a dedicated website that highlights
                    and demonstrates your strengths and abilities as a web
                    developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this assignment, you can use any web development
                    technologies you'd like. And, not to worry, you won't have
                    to code your portfolio from scratch! In fact, that's not a
                    good use of your valuable time. You can even use the
                    portfolio app you worked on in Level 3 if you‚Äôd like to.

                <p>
                    <strong>Start <em>very</em> basic</strong>. Resist the
                    temptation to add a lot of bells and whistles right up
                    front. Just because you <em>can</em> doesn't mean you
                    <em>should!</em>
                    <strong>CLEAR over cute or clever</strong> will always win
                    the day so keep it simple. Hiring managers simply need to be
                    able to glean basic information about you and see your
                    skills in action quickly and easily.
                    <strong
                        >Make the path to hiring you as simple and clean as
                        possible</strong
                    >.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Creating a <strong>minimal</strong>,
                    <strong>well-designed website</strong> that contains your
                    <strong>primary</strong> important information is more than
                    sufficient in order to pass this assignment (and get hired).
                </p>

                <h4>Pick a Template</h4>
                <p>
                    You do NOT need to design a portfolio from scratch
                    (remember, you‚Äôre a developer, not a designer) so don‚Äôt
                    stress at all about coming up with some unique design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead, we recommend using a template as your
                    <strong>starting point</strong> and tweaking it to your
                    liking so you can quickly, simply, and efficiently create a
                    compelling, professional portfolio. Keep it
                    <strong>simple and clean</strong>, and let your projects
                    speak for themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    RECOMMENDED PLATFORM:
                    <a
                        href="https://html5up.net/"
                        target="_blank"

                    >
                </p>

                <h4>Projects to Include</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>Less is more.</strong> It‚Äôs better to have 2‚Äì3
                    solid, complete projects that are well-built than have 5‚Äì6
                    that don‚Äôt showcase your skills or are incomplete. This can
                    include a combination of the following:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Capstone projects</strong> ‚Äì Include your
                        capstone projects from Levels 4, 5 and 6.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Personal project(s)</strong> ‚Äì Any project(s)
                        you‚Äôve been working on outside of the course.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Any relevant client work</strong> ‚Äì If you did
                        any dev work for a business, make sure to add it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>You can add an ongoing project</strong>. The
                        project does not have to be fully complete with all the
                        features you have planned for it. Once you have the MVP
                        done, you can add it to your portfolio. Add a
                        description of future improvements or features you want
                        to add.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    You might not have projects to add just yet, and that‚Äôs
                    okay! Right now, you‚Äôre simply creating the framework with
                    your basic information now. By the time you‚Äôre done with
                    this course, all you‚Äôll have to do is plug and link your
                    projects and you‚Äôll be ready!

                        >Please note‚Ä¶ avoid using past assignments as portfolio
                        pieces. The only time where this might be okay is if you
                        used an assignment as a starting point and then extended
                        it with enough features. If you‚Äôre unsure, double-check
                        with an instructor.</em

                        If you haven‚Äôt already, initialize a git repo within
                        your app:
                        <pre
                            role="region"
                            aria-label="Bash commands"><code class="language-bash">git init

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create a repo on Github with this name:
                        <code>[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io]</code>
                        <pre
                            role="region"
                            aria-label="Bash commands"><code class="language-bash">git branch -M main

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In your React app run the following command:
                        <pre
                            role="region"

                    <li>
                        Then in the <code>package.json</code> file, add the
                        following <code>predeploy</code> and
                        <code>deploy</code> properties to the ‚Äúscripts‚Äù object:
                        <br /><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Depending on what you
                        used to create your app, make sure you specify the
                        correct build folder name for the
                        <code>deploy</code> property:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Vite:</strong>

                            <li>

                    <li>
                        Now run

                    <li>
                        Go to the repository on Github.

                    <li>
                        Navigate to <strong>Settings &gt; Pages</strong> and
                        change the following settings under the
                        <strong>Build and deployment</strong> section:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Set <code>Source</code> to
                                <code>Deploy from a branch</code>
                            </li>
                            <li>Select <code>gh-pages</code> as the branch</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It may take a few minutes, but you should be able to see
                        your published portfolio at
                        <code>YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io</code>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h4>2. Deploy through Surge</h4>
                <p>
                    <em>Note:</em> At 1:58, the command
                    <code>surge dist</code> targets the build folder, titled
                    ‚Äúdist‚Äù. If you made your react app using create-react-app,
                    the folder is called ‚Äúbuild‚Äù, so run
                    <code>surge build</code> instead.
