                    You are going to build an React app that allows a user to
                    post things that they think are ugly. The data of ugly
                    things should be managed by React Context. You will be using
                    the

                <p>
                    This assignment is for practicing context. In the real
                    world, if you wanted to build this, you probably would not
                    use context. For that reason, it may feel a bit contrived.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Think of your component tree. You need to have a form for
                    submission, and a list of ugly things. These two components
                    would probably be siblings. Usually, it would be easy enough
                    to lift state to their parent, so that the form can add to
                    an array of ugly things in the state of the parent, and the
                    parent can pass that array down as props to a component to
                    display that list. For this project, we'll have our context
                    provider manage the state of our array.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Context is tough, so be prepared to spend some time on this
                    project.
