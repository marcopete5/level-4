                <p>
                    <strong>Introduction:</strong><br />This project offers a
                    valuable opportunity to showcase your skills and
                    achievements, making it an excellent addition to your resume
                    or portfolio.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Deployment Consideration:</strong><br />To ensure
                    compliance with deployment requirements and facilitate
                    effective management of your project, it's advisable to
                    create a dedicated repository for this project. This allows
                    for easy access and organization, whether deploying during
                    the course or upon completion. If you need a refresher on
                    how do this it’s covered in the Front-End Deployment video
                    above. Be careful when making this new repo!
                    <strong>Do not</strong> nest your repositories by creating a
                    new repository within an existing repository.

                <h3>API Notes</h3>
                <p>Use Postman to test the API where needed</p>
                <p><strong>Same Origin Policy</strong></p>
                <p>
                    One of the big challenges in accessing APIs is getting
                    around the browser's "Same Origin Policy".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of the APIs above require you to make requests from a
                    server instead of the client. V School has built a small,
                    simple request forwarder to help make this process easier.
                    It may not work in all cases, and should only be used if you
                    know your API of choice doesn't allow frontend requests.
